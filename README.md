### Technologies

- Dropdown menus and several information links throughout the page make the site easy to navigate and quickly find information. 
- The in addition to standard text web site provides information to users utilizing embeded maps and videos.

### Challenges 
- The main challenge of this application came down to data modeling. With the site containing 31 different views, and 2 separate forms the application required extensive data modeling to keep all this information well organized and modular.  
- Embedding links to google map Iframes and YouTube videos also provided a challenge that was overcome with some inline JavaSript.

### Minimum Viable Product (Version 1)
 - Users can Log In with email to access the Patient Portal. 
 - Users will fill out form providing information.
 - Users will be able to access information about physicians. 
 - Users will be able to access information about offices, seeing the office location via an embedded google map, and link to the physicians working out of the office. 
 - Users will be able to access information about a variety of conditions the practice treats with information sourced from a reputable resource.

###Contributions to be added (for Version2)
-I would link to set up an administrator side to the site allowing for an administrator to easily change or add information. 
-This would allow for greater functionality to sections like the patient forms as well allowing the admin or even a physician account to access patient info and add documents such as lab results.
